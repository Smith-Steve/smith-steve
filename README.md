### Hi There!

I'm Steve Smith, I'm a software developer based in California. A little bit about me as a software developer:

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- React.js
- CSS3
- HTML5
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- HTML5


Are the core technologies that I am currently well versed in. I came across my passion for software engineering while working in a variety of technology based roles in the Healthcare industy, which showed me how exciting it is to be a developer and work along side them. During my time in that field, I learned SQL, VBA and other tools that helped my employer solve important issues - but I could see that there were problems that could be solved in a more fundamental way with software.

few things things are as engrossing to me as the problems in making software work in a practical manner - realizing a smooth way to solve issues of transforming, representing and sending data is what software is all about!

## I'm currently working on
I have two main focuses right now. The first focus is to rewrite an application that I previously wrote in node.js into C#, adhering to best practices. The second is to learn about how to work with cloud based applications.

An appplication called "Drip-Email-System" which is designed to allow users to manage their e-mail campaigns but to make reciever's believe they are the targets of a specific individual e-mail campaign from the sender.
