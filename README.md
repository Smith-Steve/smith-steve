### Hi There!

I'm Steve Smith, I'm a software developer based in California. A little bit about me as a software developer:

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- React.js
- CSS3
- HTML5
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- HTML5


Are the core technologies that I am currently well versed in. I came across my passion for software engineering while working in a variety of technology based roles in the Healthcare industy, which showed me how exciting it is to be a developer and work along side them. During my time in that field, I learned SQL, VBA and other tools that helped my employer solve important issues - but I could see that there were problems that could be solved in a more fundamental way with software.

Few things are as engrossing to me as the problems involved in making software work in a practical manner - realizing the proper way to solve the issues of transforming and changing data are what software is all about!
